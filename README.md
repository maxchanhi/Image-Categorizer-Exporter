A browser-based tool to help you efficiently sort and categorize your images. Load your photos, define custom categories, and assign images with a simple click or keyboard shortcuts. Features include:

- Purely Client-Side: Runs entirely in your web browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with JSZip for zipping). No server-side processing needed.
- Download images grouped by category into separate ZIP files.
- Flexible Image Input: Select individual files or entire folders.
- Custom Categories: Create, save, and load your category lists (as JSON).
- Assign images to categories with dedicated buttons or number keys (1-9).
- Save your entire categorization progress (assigned images, skipped images, current position, category definitions) to a JSON file.
